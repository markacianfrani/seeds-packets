            Racine uses a GitHub action to sync the svg files for our icons from our [master icon kit in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rc2gk7oZcvueGix29jvoCZ/Nectar-Icons). This script runs every day at 10:30am and 4:30pm.

            Whenever you need to release any icon changes into seeds-icons, you can merge this PR into `main` and include it in the next scheduled release of the package.

            **Be sure to take a look at the changes files to make sure everything is in order before merging.**
